In this paper, we analyze detailed information of 70,000 fourth-graders attending about 1,200 publicly subsidized schools in the context of the Chilean voucher system. We model the school choice of a household as a discrete choice of a single school, based on the random utility model developed by McFadden (1974) and the speciﬁcation of Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995), which includes choicespeciﬁc unobservable characteristics and deals with potential endogeneity. Our results imply that households value some attributes of schools, with the two most important dimensions being test scores and distance to school. Interestingly, at the same time, our results suggest there is a lot of heterogeneity in preferences because the valuation of most school attributes depend on household characteristics. In particular, we ﬁnd that while proximity to school is an inferior attribute, test scores is a normal attribute. We present evidence that our results are mainly driven by self-selection and not by school-side selection. As a ﬁnal check, we compute the average enrollment elasticity with respect to all school attributes and ﬁnd that higher elasticities are correlated with higher supply of the attribute, especially in the case of test scores-enrollment elasticities for private schools.},

In this paper, we explore the possibility of imposing shape restrictions to improve the performance of the NPIV estimators. We assume that the function to be estimated is monotone and consider a sieve estimator that enforces this monotonicity constraint. We deﬁne a constrained measure of ill-posedness that is relevant for the constrained estimator and show that, under a monotone IV assumption and certain other mild regularity conditions, this measure is bounded uniformly over the dimension of the sieve space. This ﬁnding is in stark contrast to the well-known result that the unconstrained sieve measure of illposedness that is relevant for the unconstrained estimator grows to inﬁnity with the dimension of the sieve space. Based on this result, we derive a novel non-asymptotic error bound for the constrained estimator. The bound gives a set of data-generating processes for which the monotonicity constraint has a particularly strong regularization effect and considerably improves the performance of the estimator. The form of the bound implies that the regularization effect can be strong even in large samples and even if the function to be estimated is steep, particularly so if the NPIV model is severely ill-posed. Our simulation study conﬁrms these ﬁndings and reveals the potential for large performance gains from imposing the monotonicity constraint.},

Both commands are able to impose monotonicity of the estimated function. The use of such a shape restriction may signiﬁcantly improve the performance of the NPIV estimator (Chetverikov and Wilhelm 2017). This is because the ill-posedness of the NPIV estimation problem leads to unconstrained estimators that suﬀer from particularly poor statistical properties such as very high variance. The constrained estimator that imposes the monotonicity, on the other hand, signiﬁcantly reduces variance by removing oscillations of the estimator that is nonmonotone. We provide a small Monte Carlo experiment to study the estimators’ ﬁnite sample properties and an application to the estimation of gasoline demand functions.},

We describe examples, theoretical calculations and simulations to elucidate situations in which the speciﬁcation is and is not important. A key conclusion is the large degree of robustness of maximum likelihood for a wide variety of commonly encountered situations.

We prove that the distribution of random coefficients in the multinomial logit model is nonparametrically identified. Our approach requires variation in product characteristics only locally and does not rely on the special regressors with large supports used in related papers. One of our two identification arguments is constructive. Both approaches may be applied to other choice models with random coefficients.}

We find that each cent-per-gallon increase in the price of gasoline reduces the equilibrium gasoline consumption by about 0.2 percent. Taking account of revenue recycling, the impact of a 25-cent gasoline tax increase on the average household is about \$30 per year (2001 dollars). Distributional impacts depend importantly on how additional revenues from the tax increase are recycled. (JEL D12, H22, H25, L62, L71)},

Despite a modest undervaluation of fuel costs, fuel taxes are more effective in reducing fuel usage than product taxes. They also perform better in terms of welfare, even when usage demand is held fixed. The reason is that fuel taxes better target high mileage consumers to purchase fuel efficient cars.

We examine potential explanations and document that behavioral explanations, in particular salience of the policy instruments, lie at the root of our ﬁndings; for a number of the salient versions of vehicle tax and fuel costs we then construct, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of their correct valuation. This also holds when using different measures of news and online search activity as proxies for salience.

This paper exploits a unique and extremely rich vehicle-level dataset of all new vehicles registered in California in 2001{\textendash}2003 and then subsequently given a smog check in 2005{\textendash}2009, a period of steady economic growth but rapidly increasing gasoline prices after 2005. The primary empirical result is a medium-run estimate of the elasticity of vehicle-miles-traveled with respect to gasoline price for new vehicles of -0.22. There is evidence of considerable heterogeneity in this elasticity across buyer types, demographics, and geography. Surprisingly, the vehicle-level responsiveness is increasing with income, perhaps due to within-household switching of vehicles. The estimated elasticity has important implications for the effectiveness of price policies, such as increased gasoline taxes or a carbon policy, in reducing greenhouse gases. The heterogeneity in the elasticity underscores differing distributional and local air pollution benefits of policies that increase the price of gasoline.},

Using the implied changes in willingness-to-pay, we find that consumers act myopically: consumers are indifferent between \$1 in discounted fuel costs and 15-38 cents in the vehicle purchase price when discounting at 4\%.
