## Abstract The differentiated products demand model (BLP) initiated by Berry (1994) and Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995) has become a major tool in the empirical IO literature as it allows researchers to estimate demand using only market level data while allowing for preference heterogeneity. A large majority of applications impose strong parametric restrictions on the distribution of the random coefficients despite a vast literature on its nonparametric identification and estimation. These assumptions are rarely grounded in economic theory and pose serious credibility concerns on the validity of counterfactual analyses.  In our paper, we develop a generic moment-based specification test on the distribution of random coefficients in the BLP model and we prove its asymptotic validity and consistency. Furthermore, we derive a theoretical expression for the instrument which maximizes rejection power under misspecification and we provide a feasible first order approximation of this most powerful instrument. We further show that these instruments can be effectively used to estimate the model and particularly so when the distribution of random coefficients is flexibly parametrized. Finally, we conduct simulation exercises to examine the finite sample properties of our tests and instruments and we apply these new tools to study the welfare effects of different taxation schemes in the German car market.
