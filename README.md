## Abstract
The BLP demand model for differentiated products is the workhorse model for demand estimation with market-level data. This model uses random coefficients to account for unobserved preference heterogeneity. The shape of the distribution of random coefficients matters greatly for many counterfactual quantities, such as the cost pass-through. In this paper, we develop new econometric tools to test this distribution and improve its estimation under a flexible parametrization. First, we construct new instruments that are designed to detect deviations from the true distribution of random coefficients. Second, we develop a formal moment-based specification test on the distribution of random coefficients. Third, we show that our instruments can be successfully used to estimate a flexible distribution of random coefficients. Finally, we validate our approach with Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application using data on car purchases in Germany. We also show that these methods extend to the mixed logit demand model with individual-level data.
