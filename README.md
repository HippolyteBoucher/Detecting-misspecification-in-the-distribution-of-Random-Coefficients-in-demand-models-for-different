## Abstract
The differentiated products demand model initiated by Berry (1994) and Berry, Levinsohn and Pakes (1995) is the workhorse model for demand estimation with market-level data. This model utilizes random coefficients to account for unobserved preference heterogeneity. The shape of the distribution of random coefficients matters  greatly for many counterfactual quantities, such as the pass-through. In this paper, we develop new econometric tools to test this distribution and improve its estimation under a flexible parametrization. In particular, we construct new instruments that are designed to detect deviations from the underlying distribution of random coefficients. Then, we develop a formal moment-based specification test on the distribution of random coefficients. Next, we show that our instruments can strengthen the identifying power of the moment conditions used for estimation. Finally, we validate our approach with Monte Carlo simulations  and an empirical application using data on car purchases in Germany. We show that these methods extend to the mixed logit demand model (with individual-level data).
